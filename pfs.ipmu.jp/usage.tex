\section{Abstract}

In this document, internet based services related on the PFS Project are summarized 
as of the day of release of this document. 

\section{New account registration}

If you are new to PFS, you will need to request several accounts: 
"SuMIRe/PFS pbworks wiki" (account name is email address), 
"pfs.ipmu.jp" (you need to pick account name), 
"PFS JIRA" (open registration), and 
"GitHub" (organization member for private repositories). 
Submit your account request as following account policy and registration. 

\subsection{Account policy}

Issuing account will depend on your role in the PFS project --- 
technical team member (from each collaborating institute and Subaru) 
or science team member. 
Refer following section.~\ref{sec:listofregist} for procedures to get accounts. 

\subsubsection{Technical team member}

You need at least to request an account to log in to 
SuMIRe/PFS pbworks wiki and \url{https://pfs.ipmu.jp}.
In addition, if you work for software development, you can optionally 
request a member privilege of GitHub: this is needed for you to access 
to private repositories. 
GitHub is also used for an issue tracking system for the development of 
ICS (Instrument Control Software). Software documentation (ics\_doc) 
repository is also on GitHub as a private repository. 

Meanwhile, JIRA is used as a management tool for the development of 
the other PFS software packages than ICS, such as DRP (Data Reduction 
Pipeline), ETS (Exposure Targeting Software) and SPT (Survey Planning 
and Tracking software). PFS JIRA (https://pfspipe.ipmu.jp) is open to 
the public, but is operated in an integration of single sign on (SSO) with 
other services (LDAP service of pfs.ipmu.jp), you need to use the same 
account name and password. If you already have an account at pfs.ipmu.jp 
and have not logged in to PFS JIRA before, you need to contact to 
\url{jira@pfs.ipmu.jp} to activate your account in PFS JIRA.
