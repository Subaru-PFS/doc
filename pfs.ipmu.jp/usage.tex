\section{Abstract}

In this document, internet based services related on PFS Project are summarized 
as of the day of release. 

\section{New account registration}

If you are new to PFS, you will need to request several accounts: 
"SuMIRe/PFS pbworks wiki" (account name is email address), 
"pfs.ipmu.jp" (you need to select account name), 
"PFS JIRA" (open registration). 
Submit your account request as following account policy and registration. 

\subsection{Account policy}

Issuing account will depend on your role at the PFS project --- 
technical team member (from each collaborating institution and Subaru) 
or science team member. 

\subsubsection{Technical team member}

You need at least to request an account to log in to https://pfs.ipmu.jp.
In addition, if you work for software development, you can optionally 
request a member privilege of GitHub: this is needed for you to access 
to private repositories. 
GitHub is also used for an issue tracking system for the development of 
ICS (Instrument Control Software).

To make these requests, please ask the local site manager at your institute 
to send the following information to \url{pfsprojectoffice@ipmu.jp}. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Your contact email address.
  \item Preferred account name for pfs.ipmu.jp.
  \item Photo for photo directory at pfs.ipmu.jp. (JPEG, less than 50kB; width 
    250--300pixel, height 250--350pixel)
  \item (If you are software developers or related workers) Your GitHub account name
\end{itemize}

For the Git repositories operated at GitHub, 
there is one (mostly private) team per institute where the members have 
the admin privilege. 
You can ask a member of the team in your institute to add yourself and 
get the admin privilege to the repositories related to the development 
activities at your institute.

Meanwhile, JIRA is used as a management tool for the development of 
the other PFS software packages than ICS, such as DRP (Data Reduction 
Pipeline), ETS (Exposure Targeting Software) and SPT (Survey Planning 
and Tracking software). PFS JIRA (https://pfspipe.ipmu.jp) is open to 
the public, and register yourself to participate in the PFS JIRA.


\subsubsection{Science team member}

If you don't have SuMIRe/PFS pbworks wiki account, first request an account 
for SuMIRe/PFS pbworks wiki.
