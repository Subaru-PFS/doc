Account policy and procedures
******

This page presents PFS account policy and procedures on registration, update, 
or contacts on trouble. 

First of all, if you are a member of the institutes in the PFS collaboration, 
you need an account for access to SuMIRe/PFS PBworks wiki page. 
You can go to `Request access <http://sumire.pbworks.com/w/request-access>`_
page and request an account. 

After you have access to this SuMIRe/PFS PBworks wiki, your needs of other 
accounts and services depend on your role in the PFS project as explained 
in `Technical team member`_ and `Science team member`_. 
Follow the instructions and request appropriate account(s). 
If you already have some of the accounts and plan to request others, 
please read `Notes and tips for the registration process`_.
Note that the contents in the services for PFS software development are 
open to the public (apart from a part of them in the private repositories), 
so they are readable without any account. 

Technical team member
------

If you are committing to works for the instrument development as a member 
in the technical team of the PFS project, you need to get an account to use 
`services of pfs.ipmu.jp (https) <https://pfs.ipmu.jp>`_ at least. 
Optionally you need access to 
software development tools (like `PFS JIRA <https://pfspipe.ipmu.jp/jira/>`_ 
or `Subaru-PFS GitHub <https://github.com/Subaru-PFS>`_) if you work 
on software development. Ask the local site manager at your institution 
to send the following information to pfsprojectoffice at ipmu.jp.

* Your contact email address
* Preferred account name
* Photo for photo directory at pfs.ipmu.jp (JPEG, less than 50kB; width 250-300 pixels, height 250-350 pixels)
* If you will work on software development (in any area of PFS software development) 

  * Request of access to PFS JIRA
  * Your GitHub account

Once your request is granted, the account information for pfs.ipmu.jp (https) 
is emailed, so you must change your password from the initial one delivered 
by the email. If you need to reset your password, contact pfs at pfs.ipmu.jp.

Science team member
------

If you are not working for the instrument development, you are categorized as 
a science team member here, and usually you do not need any other account. 
But depending on your roles and contributions to the studies of PFS science 
cases and survey planning, you may need an account to use services at 
pfs.ipmu.jp (https). 
In this case, please go back and read `Technical team member`_. 
In particular, if you plan to contribute to software development, 
you should follow the procedure as follows:

* Contact a local site manager at your institute in the PFS technical team and formalize your commitment(s) to the software development.
* `Register to PFS JIRA <https://pfspipe.ipmu.jp/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa>`_, if you need to participate in discussions by filing tickets, sending comments, and so on.
* Send your GitHub account name by email to github at pfs.ipmu.jp, if you need to push to git repositories for software coding works, code reviews, and documentations. 

Notes and tips for the registration process
------

* If you already have a pfs.ipmu.jp (https) account but cannot login to PFS JIRA, you should send an email to jira at pfs.ipmu.jp, instead of registration at signup page. 
* You will receive email from GitHub but not from the PFS project for further registration procedures to GitHub organization. Registration process will not finish unless you follow these procedures. This registration to GitHub organization does not mean to subscribe activities of repositories, you need to subscribe repositories in interest by yourself if you want. 
* PFS GitHub is open to the public, so you can read the contents and add comments except for those in the private repositories, but you cannot push to git repositories unless you follow the above procedure.
* PFS JIRA is open to the public, so you can read the contents, but you cannot make any commitments therein unless you follow the above procedure.
* In the PFS GitHub organization, there is one team per institute where the members are given admin privilege. So instead of sending email to github at pfs.ipmu.jp, you can also ask the members in your institute to add yourself with privilege given to repositories related to your institute.
