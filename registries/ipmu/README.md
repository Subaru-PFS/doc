# IPMU Document Registry

This registry serves as a means to: 

* Track existing documents by IPMU, Durham and PO
* Determine document codes for new documents

The registry file is [documents.csv](documents.csv).

## Rule of the code

Overall rule is available on PFS internal wiki (PBworks). 
The 6 digits for the document code is divided to three sections: `%1d+%2d+%3d`

- `%1d` indicates [institute](#Institute)
- `%2d` indicates [author](#Author)
- `%3d` indicates document number

Details for each section is described below.
